# Planned Objective

Build an e-commerce website with a fully functioning back end to take customer orders, accept payment, and store order data.

# Technologies Used

## Back-End:
- noSQL
- MongoDB
- Express
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- Stripe

## Front-End:
- HTMl5/CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Modals
- Toast
- Stripe

# The Process

We began from the templates as suggested, and our senior team members immediately dived into the pair programming process with enthusiasm, while newcomer team members had the opportunity to help and learn new technologies and tricks.  Difficulties began to arise with the new noSQL data structure, however, we leveraged our combined experience and worked together to overcome the challenges.  Our single biggest difficulty was acclimating to the Git workflow process as a team, however, with good humor and patience we were able to use Git to deliver an effective MVP.

# Outstanding Issues

Small issues with front end styling, widget wish-list, refactoring code for maximized efficiency, "seller mode" for vendors as well as users
